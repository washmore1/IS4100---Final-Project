This GitHub repository is a consolidation and culmination of the work I have done throughout the fall semester in IS 4100, Sports Analytics Development.
Primarily throughout this course, we have used the NFL_data_py API, looking mostly at play-by-play data from the 2016-2024 seasons. This repository includes my
Colab analysis documents, including Standard Linear Regression modeling, Logistic Regression Modeling, Poisson modeling, some introduction to web scraping, PCA, Clustering,
among other things:

**Skills I have Practice & Developed**
- Advanced in my Python abilities
- Gained proficiency in using modeling libraries such as statsmodels and SciKitLearn
- Developed better visualization skills and best-practice techniques in SeaBorn and MatPlotLib
- Practiced in analyzing model results and using statistics to improve my models
- Learned how to web scrape, then clean and format data to make it operational
