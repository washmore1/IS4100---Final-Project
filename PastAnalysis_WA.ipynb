These teams that I have selected have had and will have varying levels of success on the football field, and I hope to get a deeper look into some of the underlying statistics that can be part of the explanation as to why one franchise tends to be more successful than another.\n",

        "Extending off of this, I am interested in looking at trends of some basic statistics, like passing yardage vs. rushing yardage, and defensive passing yards allowed vs. rushing yards allowed. This allows me to get my feet wet with some easier, more straightforward stats, while getting a better look at what a team is good at and what they struggle at. In addition, this will give a glimpse at the varying styles of play that each team in my selections deploy. Teams like the San Francisco 49ers and the Miami Dolphins have built strong reputations for running creative offenses, with unique formations and play concepts that are different from the traditional, pro-style offenses that the New Orleans Saints and Tampa Bay Buccaneers have utilized in recent memory."

        "- The Houston Texans far and away showed the greatest improvement between the 2022 and '23 seasons, increasing their win total from 3 wins to 11 wins and reaching the NFL playoffs, even winning a game in the Wild Card round. Much of this dramatic improvement can be attributed to the addition of rookie QB C.J. Stroud. In 2022, with Davis Mills at QB, the Texans struggled to the tune of 214 Passing yards per game. In 2023 with Stroud, that number was 265 passing yards per game. Beyond this, Mills' \"bad throw\" rate was a whopping 23.2% with a brutal \"on-target\" % of 70%, well below the other QB's I analyzed in this list. Stroud proved to be a large improvement in both categories, posting numbers of 20% and 75%.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The numbers I pulled supported the infamous reputation of the Chicago Bears to be a run-first, poor-passing offense. In both 2022 and 2023, the Bears led my list of teams in rushing yards per game and were last in passing yards per game. Amazingly, the Bears averaged only 152 yards passing per game in 2022! While former QB Justin Fields is a dynamic athlete with an ability to make breathtaking plays, his passing ability simply never developed in Chicago to a place where they could reliably and effectively use his arm. That's why they drafted Caleb Williams with the no.1 overall pick last April.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The consensus top team in my list of selected franchises for this project, the 49ers success appears to have a lot to do with a dominant defense. In both 2022 and 2023, the 49ers reached the postseason, including a super bowl appearance last season. In both 2022 and 2023, the 49ers defense allowed less than 100 yards per game, while improving their pass defense greatly between '22-'23. The offense more than held their own as well, ranking #2 among my teams in both passing and rushing offense in 2023. Interestingly enough, the 49ers have maintained and built upon their offensive success while changing QB's, with Jimmy Garoppolo and Trey Lance both seing extensive reps before coach Mike Shanahan settled on Brock Purdy as the face of the franchise. Those are the ingredients of a well-run franchise that hopes to continue competing for super bowls in the future.\n",

        "##**Alignment with Research**\n",
        "- In the previous research assignment, I asserted that two of my franchises (the Miami Dolphins and the San Francisco 49ers) in particular are known for creative, balanced, and explosive offenses. I think that assertion is supported by the research in this assignment:\n",
        "  - Miami Dolphins offensive rankings (among my teams)\n",
        "    - Passing: #1\n",
        "    - Rushing: #3\n",
        "  - San Francisco 49ers offensive rankings (among my teams)\n",
        "    - Passing: #2\n",
        "    - Rushing: #2\n",
        "\n",
        "- In addition, I believe this research aligns with the common thought that QB play is the strongest indicator of a team's success. I have previously pointed out with the Houston Texans struggles in 2022 with Davis Mills at QB versus their success in 2023 with rising star C.J. Stroud at the helm, but this isn't the only example in my 8-team scope. In the opposite direction, the Washington Commanders win total decreased 4 games from somewhat-competitive 8-9 record in 2022, to an abysmal 4-13 record in 2023. This correlates with the Commanders' change from the servicable Taylor Heinicke to a young, inexperienced QB in Sam Howell."
